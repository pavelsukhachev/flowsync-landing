## Social Proof

### **Sarah Kim, Creative Director at Pixel & Co**
*"We tried Asana, Monday, ClickUp—everything. FlowSync is the first tool that actually understands how creative agencies work. Our client satisfaction scores jumped 40% in the first quarter because nothing falls through the cracks anymore."*

### **Marcus Thompson, Founder of RemoteFirst Digital**
*"Scaling from 8 to 35 remote employees in 18 months would've been impossible without FlowSync. The timezone features alone saved us from hiring three additional project managers."*

### **Diana Rodriguez, Operations Director at ScaleCraft**
*"Client churn dropped 60% after we started using FlowSync's client portals. Our clients finally feel 'in the loop' without us drowning in update emails. It's like having an extra account manager for every project."*

### **Alex Chen, CEO of Bright Ideas Agency**
*"The ROI was immediate. We save 15+ hours per week on status meetings and client updates. That's $3,000+ in billable time we've reclaimed every single week."*

## FAQ

### **Q: How is FlowSync different from Monday.com, Asana, or ClickUp?**
**A:** Most project tools are built for co-located teams. FlowSync is specifically designed for remote work realities—time zone coordination, asynchronous communication, and client transparency without meeting overload. We're not trying to be everything to everyone; we're the best solution for remote agencies and distributed teams.

### **Q: Will my clients actually use the client portal?**
**A:** 94% of our clients' clients actively use the portal within 30 days. The key is that it's designed for *them*, not for project managers. Simple, clean, and focused on what they care about: progress, next steps, and when they'll see results.

### **Q: How long does onboarding take?**
**A:** Most teams are fully operational within 48 hours. Our migration tool imports your existing projects from any platform, and our onboarding specialist personally ensures your first project runs smoothly. No 6-week implementation process here.

### **Q: What if we have unique workflow needs?**
**A:** FlowSync adapts to your workflow, not the other way around. Custom fields, automated rules, and flexible project templates mean you can mirror exactly how your team already works—just without the chaos.

### **Q: Can we control what clients see?**
**A:** Absolutely. Granular permissions let you decide exactly what each client sees—from high-level progress to detailed task lists. You can even create different views for different client stakeholders.

### **Q: What happens when team members leave?**
**A:** Knowledge doesn't walk out the door. All project context, decisions, and client communications are automatically documented and transferable. New team members ramp up in days, not months.
